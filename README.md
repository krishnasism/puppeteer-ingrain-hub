# puppeteer-ingrain-hub
A simple program to navigate to a web page using puppeteer

# Usage

## Setup NodeJS for this project
Clone the project.
Since pushing the project would have taken >100MB, and GitHub would have disabled the option to push the repository, therefore I had to remove the npm project files. 

## Initialize the directory
```
npm init
```
## Install Puppeteer
```
npm i puppeteer
```
### Run the project
```
node index.js
```
